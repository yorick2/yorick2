### Hellooo there ðŸ‘‹. Feel free to look around my work and steal the an idea or two. Even a few open source projects I created.

Programming for me is a mix of a hobby and a passion. Like many programmers the desire to fix broken or poor code has led to many a time of cringe; using poorly implemented systems you want to improve the ui of or the general ux from badly designed sysems that make you weep. But when i get my hands on one to improve or design Im like a pig in the proverbial mud but hopfully don't become dinner.

I started in the magic of the programming in 2012 and have worked with various languages in my programming life. My desire to help people descover programming and provide high quality solutions to issues people have drives me forward on a daily basis. But its also my love of coding that powers my code here mostly made during my free time and is only dapened by a cup of tea growing low.

ðŸ”­ I am currently working on a website to help a biblical language learning website, which works along side other learning to cement the langauges being learnt.

ðŸ’¬ I will be looking for pat time opotunities to code in the near future to my current work relationships.
